PyDOL is a Python interface for resolved stellar photometric studies using HST and JWST. PyDOL contains HST and JWST pipelines for re-processing data using the latest calibration files from CRDS. A Python wrapper for DOLPHOT is included for crowd-field PSF Photometry and completeness analysis for HST-ACS, HST-WFC3, and JWST-NIRCAM data.
