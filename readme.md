# **PyDOL**

PyDOL is a Python interface for resolved stellar photometric studies using HST and JWST. PyDOL contains HST and JWST pipelines for re-processing data using the latest calibration files from CRDS. A Python wrapper for DOLPHOT is included for crowd-field PSF Photometry and completeness analysis for HST-ACS, HST-WFC3, and JWST-NIRCAM data. Additionally, PyDOL includes modules for Bayesian Star Formation History analysis tools which use PARSEC isochrones.
